Installation
============

There are several ways to install the vcon library.

Using pip
---------

The simplest way to install vcon is using pip:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install vcon

Using Poetry (recommended for development)
---------------------------------------

For development, we recommend using Poetry:

1. First, install Poetry if you haven't already:

   .. code-block:: bash

       curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -

2. Clone the repository:

   .. code-block:: bash

       git clone https://github.com/yourusername/vcon-lib.git
       cd vcon-lib

3. Install dependencies:

   .. code-block:: bash

       poetry install

This will create a virtual environment and install all dependencies, including development dependencies.

Requirements
-----------

vcon requires Python 3.8 or later and has the following main dependencies:

- authlib>=1.3.2
- requests>=2.32.3
- pydash>=8.0.3
- python-dateutil>=2.9.0
- mutagen>=1.47.0

These dependencies will be automatically installed when you install vcon using any of the methods above.
